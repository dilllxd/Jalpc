# Welcome to my blog!

Welcome! I decided to update my website since I'm looking for jobs now and I figured I'd work with Jekyll since I can host cool Jekyll sites on GitHub Pages! To be honest, I'm not really sure what I'm going to be putting on here. Maybe some of my fails or adventures in the technology world or some write ups of my feelings and thoughts about stuff! In the end, don't expect much from here :)

P.S. If you have any recommendations/issues hit me up on Discord at Dilll#3130 or at [dylan@dylanh.dev](mailto:dylan@dylanh.dev). (However, Discord will get a way quicker response.)
